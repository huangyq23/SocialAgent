In order to secure the communication between client and server, you have to generate you own RSA key pair.

On a typical *nix installation
Run the following command sequentially:

$ openssl genrsa -out key.pem 1024
    This will generate the key pair.

$ cat key.pem
    This will print the private key.

$ openssl rsa -in key.pem -pubout
    This will print the public key extracted from the key pair

Copy the public and private key from the output of the above command, and paste them into client and server
configuration files.
